# ps-unity-toolkit

`ps-unity-toolkit` is an innersource project maintained by the [Game Engines Microcommunity](https://psdc-prof-services.hub.arcgis.com/pages/game-engines) in Esri PS. This toolkit is a collection of well-written, broadly applicable scripts which we've assembled into a custom Unity package to complement the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity-sdk/).
